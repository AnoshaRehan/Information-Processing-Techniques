Question No 4: DynamicList
Write a customized array by implementing the IList interface. In this question, you would not use the ArrayList or List collections.
• DynamicList would not allow inheritance.
• DynamicList would allow any type of data to be inserted into the list (string, int, etc), though only one can be used at one time.
• Implement all of the methods in IList.
• It would have a function named “DisplayAll” to display all elements present in the list.
• It would have a function “Find” which accepts one parameter and will return true if the value is found else false.
